  <h1>Susie Sumbody</h1>

  <h2>Bio:</h2>
  <p>I am a girl who codes from Sumware, CA. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to applying to colleges.
    I live at home with my mom, my brother, and my cat named Seymore.
    When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music with my friends or reading.
  </p>
  <h4 id="likes">Likes:</h4> I love a great science fiction novel. Right now I am reading The Three Body Problem, by Cixin Liu.
  <h4 id="dislikes">Dislikes:</h4> I really don't like fish. They have dead eyes that freak me out!
  <h4>Fun Fact:</h4> So far, I've been to 4 different continents! I can't wait to see the others.
